# Autonoumous Driving: Beginner to Master

This is a book that I'm writing to help beginners to master the art of autonomous driving. The book covers a wide range of topics from the basics of autonomous driving to the most advanced techniques used in the industry. The book is written in a simple and easy-to-understand language so that even beginners can understand the concepts easily.
