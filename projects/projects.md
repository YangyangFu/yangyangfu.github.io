# Projects

## 2023 
### XBot
In this project, I'm exploring the opportunities to fine tune and embed a small-sized multimodal models into a microcontroller to enable multimodal sensing and control of a robotic car. The goal is to build a multimodal robot that can see, hear, and speak.

### [Transformers for Time Series Forecasting](./2023/transformer-time-series.md)
[<img src="https://s18955.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/github.png" width="10"/>](https://github.com/YangyangFu/transformer-time-series)

Here I used the transformer architecture to forecast time series data. The transformer architecture is a powerful deep learning architecture that has been used in many NLP tasks. I am interested in exploring its potential in time series forecasting.

### LLM for Autonoumous Control
[Github](https://github.com/YangyangFu/prompt-control)

In this project, I explored the use of large language models to control various autonoumous systems in a simulation environment, such as OpenGym. The main idea is to automatically generate control codes from natural language descriptions.
