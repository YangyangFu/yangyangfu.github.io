# Projects

## 2024

### [Autonomous Driving Book](./2024/autonomous-driving-book.md) [[Github](https://github.com/YangyangFu/autonomous-driving-book)]

This is a book that I'm writing to help beginners to master the art of autonomous driving. The book covers a wide range of topics from the basics of autonomous driving to the most advanced techniques used in the industry. The book comes with a lot of code examples and exercises to help you learn the concepts better.

## 2023 

### XBot

In this project, I'm exploring the opportunities to fine tune and embed a small-sized multimodal models into a microcontroller to enable multimodal sensing and control of a robotic car. The goal is to build a multimodal robot that can see, hear, and speak.

### [Transformers for Time Series Forecasting](./2023/transformer-time-series.md) [[Github](https://github.com/YangyangFu/transformer-time-series)]

Here I used the transformer architecture to forecast time series data. The transformer architecture is a powerful deep learning architecture that has been used in many NLP tasks. I am interested in exploring its potential in time series forecasting.

### LLM for Autonoumous Control [[Github](https://github.com/YangyangFu/prompt-control)]

In this project, I explored the use of large language models to control various autonoumous systems in a simulation environment, such as OpenGym. The main idea is to automatically generate control codes from natural language descriptions.
