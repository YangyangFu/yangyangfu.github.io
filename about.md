# About Me

I love engineering math and I am a research AI engineer at Lennox International Inc. working on the Advanced Technology Group to help build the next generation of machine learning based products and services. 

Before joining Lennox, I was an Autonomous System and AI Engineer in PassiveLogic, which is a startup company in Utah, USA. I worked on the AI team to develop and prototype their first industrial digitial twin products. 
I was also an Research Enigneer in Texas A&M University. Beside advising four PhD students, I also worked on the development of an innovative end-to-end learning framework design for autonomous buildings systems, the design of deep learning based fault tolerant control algorithms, and physics-informed machine learning for optimal control etc. The projects were funded by the Department of Energy.

I obtained my PhD degree in the University of Colorado at Boulder in 2020. My PhD research was focused on the optimal control of smart data centers and smart grids to achieve sustainability and resilience goals. My PhD research was funded by the Department of Energy.
