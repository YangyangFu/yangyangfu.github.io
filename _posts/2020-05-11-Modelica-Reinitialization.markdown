# Reinitialization in Modelica Models

Previous posts have drived the formulation for Bellman optimality equations. Bellman equations can be written in terms of state value and action value. The optimal policy can be found once we can find the optimal value functions, $v_{\*}$ or $q_{\*}$, which can be theoritically calculated as follows.
